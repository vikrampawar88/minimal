### LendingClub Case Study - Exploratory Data Analysis

LendingClub is an online peer-to-peer lending platform that connects borrowers and investors.
Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). 
The goal is to identify these risky loan applicants, then risky loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 

Case study is focused on using EDA to find driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default so company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
Dataset includes complete loan data for all loans issued by Lending Club through the time period 2007 t0 2011.
